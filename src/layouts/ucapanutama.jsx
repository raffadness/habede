              My dearest Puspita, as you celebrate another year of your
              beautiful existence, I find myself overwhelmed with emotions that
              words can barely contain. You are not just my girlfriend; you are
              my soulmate, my best friend, my confidante, and the very reason my
              heart beats with purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every day with you is a gift that I cherish beyond measure. Your
              smile has the power to brighten my darkest days, your laughter is
              the sweetest melody I've ever heard, and your kindness radiates
              warmth that touches everyone around you. You've taught me what it
              means to love unconditionally and to be loved in return.
            </p>

            <p>
              I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything
              you've done for me. Thank you for your patience when I'm stubborn,
              for your understanding when I make mistakes, for your support when
              I'm struggling, and for your love that never wavers. You've been
              my rock, my safe haven, and my greatest cheerleader.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also need to apologize for all the times I've hurt you, for the
              moments I've been selfish, for the words I've said in anger, and
              for the times I haven't been the partner you deserve. I'm not
              perfect, but I promise to keep growing, learning, and becoming
              better for you every single day.
            </p>

            <p>
              On your birthday, I pray that God blesses you abundantly with
              health, happiness, success, and all the beautiful things your
              heart desires. May your dreams come true, may your goals be
              achieved, and may your life be filled with joy, love, and endless
              possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
              I want you to know that you are incredibly special, not just to
              me, but to everyone who has the privilege of knowing you. Your
              strength inspires me, your wisdom guides me, and your love
              completes me. You are the missing piece I never knew I was
              searching for until I found you.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we continue this journey together, I promise to love you more
              deeply with each passing day, to cherish every moment we share, to
              support your dreams and aspirations, and to be the partner you can
              always count on. You deserve nothing less than the world, and I'll
              spend my life trying to give it to you.
            </p>

            <p className="text-center text-xl font-semibold text-rose-600">
              I love you more than yesterday, but less than tomorrow. My love
              for you grows exponentially with each sunrise, and I can't wait to
              spend countless more birthdays celebrating the incredible person
              you are. ❤️
